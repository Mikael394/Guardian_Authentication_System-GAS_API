# School Guardian Verification API

Welcome to the School Guardian Verification API repository! This project is aimed at implementing a face recognition system to verify guardians picking up their children from school. The system is built using Django, leveraging the power of face_recognition, cv2, Django Rest Framework, Django Nested Router, NumPy, Pillow, and other essential libraries.

## Features

- **Guardian Verification**: Utilizes face recognition technology to verify the identity of guardians.
